# Hello, this is Kartike!
I am a data science enthusiast, hobby programmer and all round tech geek. I am often found tinkering with my laptop for productivity hacks, optimization techniques, and wacky designs.

I have earned a specialization in data science from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. Feel free to browse my repos for projects from these courses. I also dabble in Windows software development; check out a 'Racetrack Simulator' I built with C# using WPF.

I know R, MATLAB, C#, C++ and have experience working with Autodesk Inventor, Photoshop, and a strong proficiency with MS Office (Word, Powerpoint, Excel).
